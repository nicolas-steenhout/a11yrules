    <p>Nicolas:	Fantastic. Today we're talking to Robert Jolly and I could go on and do a long introduction, that may or may not be right. But I think I'm going to start by asking Robert to tell us in elevator pitch who Robert is, what Robert does, and what makes you tick.</p>
<p>Robert:	Okay. I am a father, and I have two boys that are five and two. Or, just about to turn five and two this weekend. And so that's the main definition of me. In terms of professional life, I am a senior web accessibility strategist at Knowbility. Knowbility is a non-profit, 501c3 non-profit based out of Austin, Texas. I live in Northern Colorado with my wife and kids. I am interested in accessibility, obviously. I'm interested in inclusive design and how we can, as web professionals, up our game and build accessibility and inclusive design into our practices.</p>
<p>Nicolas:	Cool. Thank you. I love your approach of defining yourself as a parent before any professional. I think that's really healthy. So you said that you're into web accessibility and you said obviously, so maybe we can talk about that a little bit later. I guess my first question for you would be how do you define accessibility? Because there's a lot of people that use different definition of what is or isn't web accessibility. So what is it for you?</p>

You can become an accessibility champion. By becoming a champion, disabled people will be able to function on the web just like everyone else. What's accessibility? It's the inclusive practice of building websites that are usable by everyone, regardless of level of ability for disability. A non accessible environment,  that's the problem. The problem is not using a wheelchair.</p>

<p>Denis Boudreau  <br>
I had the pleasure of working with Nic Steenhout in events that I've organized. One of the things that I really like about what Nic contributes to a conference is his perspective. He allows the audience to really understand with very down to earth, concrete, pragmatic examples how to get the job done.</p>

<p>Nic Steenhout  <br>
I've been involved in web accessibility for a good number of years, I do mostly consulting with nonprofit organizations and government organizations in the States and in Europe, helping making barrier free web. Digital accessibility work is not really about removing steps or making doors wider. But the concepts are the same. If you have a website that doesn't have image description, someone who's blind and using a screen reader, they won't be able to access the website.</p>

<p>Carie Fisher  <br>
Nic has a unique ability to captivate and engage participants from the very beginning of his talk. What truly stood out was the impact he had on our audience. </p>

<p>Nic Steenhout  <br>
We all have responsibilities, you know, we can all be superheroes and fix the web. So it's not just the responsibility of the developer. It's the responsibility of people with disabilities. And every single other stakeholders in the process.</p>

<p>Sharron Rush <br> 
He engages the audience and the attendees in a way that is very rare. He does what he does with humor.</p>

<p>Joe Dolson <br> 
Nic Steenhout is an engaging speaker, with a breadth of experience that's hard to match.</p>

You don't have to be an accessibility expert to make a positive difference in the lives of potentially millions of disabled people. What it comes down to, I think, for me, is education and awareness building from people with disabilities, to the developers, to the stakeholders, to the site owners. I like to think in terms of accessibility is to make websites usable by everyone, regardless of disability status, because we develop permanent disabilities, we develop temporary disabilities. Digital accessibility is a tech solution to a human problem. And I'm not saying that disabled people are a problem far from it. What I'm saying is, the problem is using a wheelchair when the only way in has steps! It the right thing to do. In this day and age corporations want to act ethically. And that really comes down to it. It's the right thing to do. If the environment is broken, we have a problem. If the tech is broken, we have a problem. We have to fix the environment. We have to fix the tech. And to do that we need to know there is a problem. And that's where you the champion come in. See the issues. Raise the issues. Be the squeaky wheel. Because when you do that, things are going to start to become accessible. Because it's about independence. It's about dignity. It's about humanity. Be part of the solution.</p>

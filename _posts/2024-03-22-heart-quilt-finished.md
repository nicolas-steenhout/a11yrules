Finally finished the Home is where the heart is quilt a couple weeks ago. Between washing and bringing it to show and tell for the Chilliwack Piecemakers Quilt Guild, I've only now been able to take this photo.

The colors are just glorious. Fabrics from Kaffe Fassett. I didn't know how much I'd love working with these colors. But I did. Really glad that [Stacey Day]() recommended using the dark purple at the workshop - it really works awesomely.

I am super glad to have used the backing I did - another riot of colors. I think I'm coming to really love "loud" backings.

[Marianne Penner](https://www.instagram.com/copper_rose_studio22/), a long arm quilter, did an amazing job at quilting this for me. The graffiti quilting outside the heart is stunning. The diamond quilting inside the heart really echoes the geometric patterns of the heart's pieces. 

Finished this in March 2024.

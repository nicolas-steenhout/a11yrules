title: Bowl Cozy

Tried making a bowl cozy. First attempt was far from perfect, but quite functional! Will have do do these again.

What the heck is a bowl cozy, you'll ask? At least, I asked myself that when I first heard about them. They are a bit like an oven mitt, but it's the right shape to accept a bowl. You can use them to put a bowl in the microwave to reheat things, and then you can handle the cozy rather than the hot bowl. Or you can just use it to hold a hot bowl in your hands.

We often eat hot soup while watching TV in the lounge. These bowl cozies are going to be a great replacement to the big and ugly silicone oven pads we've been using!

There are a lot of patterns for bowl cozies. I used a [pattern for bowl cozies from Craftsy](https://www.craftsy.com/post/microwave-bowl-cozy/). I used some leftover batiks, in yellow and purple. And cotton batting. Because this might be going in the microwave, it's critical that everything be 100% cotton, including your thread.

The pattern calls for 10 1/2" squares of fabric, so I started by cutting those. I really do like the purple. Not entirely sure it's the best color for this cozy, but it goes well with the yellow (color theory anyone?).

Next step in the pattern calls for stiching a corner-to-corner line on each fabric and batting unit.

Once those are stitched, you have to fold and stitch the middle of the fabric units. The instructions are clearer than my instruction though - refer to that if you want to make your own!

This is starting to look like a bowl cozy. Obviously the batting's still inside out. I pinned the units together and I'm about to stitch the edges.

I struggled a bit with sewing this, and the differences between sewing just the fabrics together in parts and the batting in other - due to how you end up cutting the corners. Something to keep in mind for the next one I make!

Stay tuned! More will come. I probably want to play with the size so we can use smaller or bigger bowls. And finish the edges better. And find fun fabrics for it.

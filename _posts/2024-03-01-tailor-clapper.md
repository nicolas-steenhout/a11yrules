I'd never heard of Tailor's clappers until I got one for Christmas. And whoaa boy, is it turning out to be a quilting tool I don't know how I lived without before! 

Basically, you use it to get flat and crisp seams. Must be hardwood. Can't be plastic. Softwoods like pine, etc aren't going to last long and won't work as well. I was lucky enough to receive one from [Modern American Vintage](https://modernamericanvintage.com/collections/quilting-tools/products/clappers).

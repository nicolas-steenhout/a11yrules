Washing fabrics, or finished quilts, with color catchers is crucial. Especially if you have reds and oranges, colors which bleed a lot into other fabrics. Color catchers are sheets of fabrics designed to absorb the die in the wash. I use [Shout Color Catchers](https://www.shoutitout.com/en-us/products/color-catcher-dye-trapping-sheet), but there are other brands out there.

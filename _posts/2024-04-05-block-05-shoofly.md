I'm not sure why, but I rather like this block. Maybe it's the name. Maybe it's the look. Maybe it's how easy it is to piece.

## New block

This one went rather quickly and I'm happy about that. Here it is before I assembled the nine squares together.

## Old block
Here's what it looked like the first time I made this block, all these years ago (2019). The points on the new one are much more accurate. And the seams are a lot crisper.

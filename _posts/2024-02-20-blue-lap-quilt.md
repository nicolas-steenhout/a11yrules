title: Blue Batiks Lap Quilt
---
I realized I don't have a quilt I made for myself. And it was time! That's what I started over the weekend.

I dug through my stash and found some batiks I got a couple years ago for a Block of the Month project from the [National Quilt Museum](https://quiltmuseum.org/) in Padducah, Kentucky. I ran into trouble with one block, and never caught up, and by the time I was ready to catch up, I realized the blocks were not inspiring me at all!

I found a pattern I liked - ["Paulitiks" from Sew Preeti Quilts](https://sewpreetiquilts.blogspot.com/2014/10/paulitiks.html). Though I'm not following it exactly. For a start, I'm making it half the size in the pattern. And I'm adding sashing between each blocks. 

I decided on my dark and medium blues, and had to pick from a bunch of other batiks I had on hand.

I went with tthe light blue, and I'm glad!

Cutting and piecing started. Taking some time to do it right. The original pattern calls for 48 blocks. I'm doing 24. But that's still piecing 96 dark or medium blue strips to black sashing!

Of course, before the next step, it's all about making sure those seams are pressed crisp and flat. Tailor's clapper to the rescue!

By the end of the weekend, I had progressed quite a bit. Here are two side by side blocks, one in dark and the other in medium, blue.

I'm hoping to finish this top this week.

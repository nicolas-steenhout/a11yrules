Finished this quilt a week ago. I just got to wrap myself in it while watching TV last night and it was VERY nice.

![Wrap around quilt laying on the grass. It is a series of light, medium, and dark blue squares separated by black sashing. There is a yellow border on the outside, and a dark blue border around that..](/images/paulitiks-finished.jpg)

Made this for myself - with a flannel backing (the same yellow flannel that I used for an accent border on the front). Used wool batting. It's nice and cozy warm!

When I dropped it off to [Marianne Penner](https://www.instagram.com/copper_rose_studio22/), a long arm quilter, she told me it was going to be about three weeks. Then we discussed that if I had it a couple days before the quilting guild meeting, I could bind it and present it to show and tell. Marianne came through! In less than 10 days she had the wonderful quilting done and it was up to me to finish it up! It was well received :) 

Finished this in March 2024.

title: Fixing a fraying seam
---
I noticed a seam that popped up and started to fray on one of my quilts. I've been staring at it and decided to finally get around to fixing it!

It's not a particularly old quilt and it hasn't been used much. But there you go, it started fraying. I'm pretty sure it's directly due to me not having enough seam allowance when I made it.

1. I started by folding the seam back and pressing it lightly.
2. I then used Heat N' Bond fusible hem
3. I finished by using a slip stitch on the side.

Hopefully this takes care of it.

Quilt is currently in the washer, it'll be hung to dry next.

See what we see.

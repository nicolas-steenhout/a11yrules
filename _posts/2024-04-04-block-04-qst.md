title: Block 04 - Quarter Square Triangles

I finished this block, and happy I did. My points are on point. My seams are crisp and flat. Quite a contrast to the first time I did this block.

## New block
Glad to be done with this one. I'm running behind on my self-imposed schedule because, wouldn't you know it, work is getting in the way of quilting! Ha!

My delay here wasn't helped by my own damn self! I started piecing all these triangles the wrong way around. And that was a bit of a "ooopsie" because I had glue basted my seams, and starched the heck out of them, and starched again. It was easier and faster to just cut more.

And here's the new pairs, pieced correctly - short sides together rather than long sides together.


![Light and dark triangle pieced with the short sides - which is the correct side. All on a grey wool pressing mat. One pieced pair is pressed open. One pair is under a clapper. A stack of unpressed pairs is on the left of the mat.](/images/qst-03.jpg)

Happy with how I got my seams to fan out in the middle.

And here's the new fabric marking pen I'm testing. So far, so good. It's a water erasable one. And unlike the other water erasable fabric pen I tried, it does not leave a wide 1/8" mark.

## Old block
For comparison, here is a photo from the first time I made this quilt.

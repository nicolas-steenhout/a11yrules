I made a cover for my Elna Lotus II sewing machine. Used mini charm packs and toweling. Very happy with how it turned out.

![Sewing machine cover in reds and whites. The side and edges are a series of 2 and a half inch squares. The body of the cover is white with red vertical stripes](/images/elna-sewing-machine-cover.jpg)

Finished this in June 2023!

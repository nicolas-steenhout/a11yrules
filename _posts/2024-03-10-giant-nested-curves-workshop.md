I was up just before 5 am yesterday, to attend an online workshop that started at 6 am! Giant Nested Curves by [Daisy Aschehoug](https://warmfolk.com/). It was fantastic and well worth the early start to the day!

It's been a hot minute since I did curves, hand pieced, with my very first quilt. 2019!!! And I liked the look of what Daisy is doing with curves. And I wanted to attend another workshop anyway since the one with [Stacey Day](/heart-quilt-workshop/) was so good.

I used scraps from my "heart quilt", which were all Kaffe Fassett fabrics. Looks like I'm making another Kaffe Fassett quilt then!
Apart from being a lot of fun, I've learned a bunch of things.

### Starching
It doesn't pay to starch fabric ahead of cutting when making curved seams. You may have to pull fabrics to make it fit in the curve, especially on smaller curves. If the fabric is starched, it no longer has the flexibility and you may not be able to make it fit.

### Glue basting
I've been using Elmer's School Glue for basting. Turns out for curves this isn't ideal since you need to set the glue by pressing it. It also doesn't have as much give.

Glue sticks are better for this purpose. While you can use the big glue sticks most school kids use, there are glue pens meant for sewing/quilting that work a charm. They are tacky enough and don't need setting. The glue doesn't "guck up" the machine. And it lasts a while - no need to rush to do your sewing.

### Building slabs
One thing we did was build "slabs" of fabrics, using a bunch of scraps. For the purpose of this exercise, having straight edges and angles for the edges of fabric was important. Learned to use the seam between two fabrics and use that as the lining point for the ruler to trim the next edge

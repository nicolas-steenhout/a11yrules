Rulers to cut fabric are critical. The problem is, they often slide on the fabric. This means you end up with cuts that aren't straight.

My favorite rulers these days are by [Creative Grid](https://creativegrids.com/). These come with a grippy surface. When you apply pressure on the ruler, it doesn't slide on the fabric. They are, however, not exactly cheap. And you're unlikely to want to buy new rulers if you already have some. 

### Non-stick stickers for rulers
You can purchase specifically designed stickers to make your existing rulers less slippery. I like the [Wingkind Non-Slip Grips for Quilting Rulers](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07L6TGMJJ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) (note, this is an Amazon link, but they are also available on eBay and at Walmart, I think).

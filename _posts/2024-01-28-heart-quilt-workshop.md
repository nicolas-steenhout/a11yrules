title: Stacey Day Workshop
---

I attended an amazing workshop yesterday. The instructer was [Stacey Day](https://staceyinstitches.com/) who is a well known local quilt designer. We worked on her "Home is where the heart is" design.

This is a 60" x 60" quilt that looks like a big heart.

I picked some [Kaffe Fassett](http://www.kaffefassett.com/) fabrics, which are a riot of colors. This is well outside my comfort zone as I tend to go for more muted fabrics. It was exciting to work with them and see my progress.

Stacey was a wonderful instructor. I learned a lot that day, and progressed the quilt.

Technique-wise, the biggest learning moment was how to use paper templates and pins to line up seams so that points are on point.

Second take home was about easing fabrics during sewing, and how the bottom fabric nearest the machine's feed dogs will move faster than the top fabric. This can be used to adjust or ease fabrics.

We didn't finish the quilt that day. But made good progress

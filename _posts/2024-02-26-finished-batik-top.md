title: Finished batik square flimsy
---

I finished the top of that quilt I'm making with batiks. It's turning out to be significantly bigger than initially planned!

<img src="images/paulitik-flimsy.jpg" alt="A 44 inches by 64 inches quilt top. 6 rows of 4 blocks. Each block has a center square, with black sashing and medium or dark blue around it. There is a 1 inch black sashing around the whole thing, and a 1 inch yellow sashing around that, and then a 4 inches dark blue batik border to finish it all." /> 

I was <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blue-lap-quilt/">making half the size of what the quilt designer came up with</a>. But with the black 1" sashing between each block, and the black 1" sashing around the main body of the quilt. All that surrounded by a yellow 1" sashing, AND a 4" dark blue batik border.... That quilt grew! It's now sitting at 44" x 64"!

The yellow sashing is flannel, and it's what I'm going to use for the backing. I originally was thinking a red flannel, but my wife suggested yellow and she was so right! Love the look of it.

Super happy with the mitered corners I did on the border, as well!

Next step will be to quilt this. Intending to use a mix of stitch in the ditch and ruler work. First time for everything. 

But before I quilt it, I need to get some wool batting!

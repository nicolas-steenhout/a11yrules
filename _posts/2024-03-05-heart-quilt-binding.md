title: Binding for "heart" quilt
---
The "Home is where the heart is" quilt is nearly ready, the long arm quilter tells me. It'll have to be bound, so I decided to work on prepping the binding today.

It was a day of worries about both my dad and my wife's dad. Couldn't really focus on much. But making binding was mindless enough. 

I calculated I needed about 300" of binding - this is a very generous amount. Probably need more like 260" but I'd rather have more and not need it than have less and be short. Besides, one of the ladies in my guild was working on project, using leftover unused binding. So it won't go to waste!

I finally found a way that gives me really even binding. Using glue, of all things! Thanks to a video from [Sharon Schamber on YouTube](https://youtu.be/a2hWQ5-ZccE?si=2UBplck4xvEHVnYv&t=145), shared by my friend Sondy.

I like to make my binding strips at 2 1/2". Gives me a bit more room to play. But I also like the look. Smaller binding doesn't work well for me.

In the end, I got my binding. It's a Kaffe Fassett print in hot pink. I used the same print pattern, but in turquoise for the quilt backing

And the long arm quilter tells me I can go get the quilt tomorrow!

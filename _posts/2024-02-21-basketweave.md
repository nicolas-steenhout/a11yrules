title: Puppy basketweave
---

I'm about to quilt this piece, and I'm excited about it. I've been really happy with the patterns. And the fabrics. Took me a while to find the fabrics I wanted to use!

The top is a series of 9 large blocks doing a basketweave pattern. Using jelly rolls. The background fabric is a white on white pattern of puppy paws. Hard to see in this photo, though.

I had enough fabrics left to piece a backing, so that's what I did. Small 9-patch blocks in the center. With a fake newsprint pattern that's all about dogs!

I'll be quilting it with a fairly straightforward meander pattern. Binding will be orange.

Stay tuned for the results!

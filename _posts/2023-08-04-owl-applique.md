I made this owl appliqu&eacute; wall hanging quilt for a friend and colleague who was expecting her first born.

![A 13 inches by 16 inches wall hanging quilt. It is all felt applique of a mama owl on top of a tree, holding a sleeping tiny owl. In the tree hole is a young owl. On another branch is another little owl. There are orange stars and crescent moon..](/images/owl-applique.jpg)

This was a kit I got at the [National Quilt Museum](https://quiltmuseum.org/), in Padducah, KY. I had no specific use in mind when I got it, but I'm glad it went to the person it went to.

Finished this in August 2023!

title: Heart quilt at the long arm quilter
---
Today, I dropped the "heart quilt" at the long arm quilter. 

<img src="/images/heart-quilt-top.JPG" alt="Colorful fabrics pieced in the shape of a heart, against a dark purple fabric" /> 

Had a good discussion with the long arm quilter about the quilting patterns to use, and which thread to use.

I should get the quilt back in a couple weeks. Can't wait!

We're going with two layers of batting: one layer 100% cotton, and another layer 100% wool. This should give a lot of loft to the quilting.

I made this lap quilt for the owners of a Christmas Tree farm. I used their logo for inspiration, and then worked out how to make the Christmas trees.

![Lap sized quilt with 12 blocks in 3 columns of 4 rows. Each block is a green christmas tree on a yellow background, with red sashing and borders around all the blocks](/images/woodsong-quilt.jpg)

The quilting on this was interesting - Used quilt in the ditch and shadow box, because it was relatively easy on my sewing machine and for my skills.

Finished this in December 2020!

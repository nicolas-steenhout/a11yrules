There are quilting terms that I use frequently that my non-quilting friends might not be familiar with. Thought I'd give you the low-down!

Quilt
: A finished product that consists of a top and bottom layer of fabric, with batting in between, and quilting to hold it all in place.    

Quilting
: What I call the activity as a whole - cutting and piecing fabrics, adding binding, sewing, etc. When I say II'm going to do some quilting, typically that's what I mean.
: Also, sewing by hand or machine to hold all the parts of a quilt together. These sewing lines are often decorative.

Fat quarter
: A piece of fabric that is a quater of a yard. Instead of four long cuts, you cut it to have four pieces of fabrics that are a more "fat" rectangle, nearly square.

Flimsy
: Also known as "top", this refers to the finished patchwork top part of what will be a quilt.

Basting
: Getting two or more pieces of fabric holding together before piecing them or quilting them. Using pins, thread, or glue.

Block
: Part of a flimsy. Typically pieced from two or more pieces of fabric. These are the "building blocks" of a quilt.

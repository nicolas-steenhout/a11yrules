Finished my third "block" for the handmade quilt. I went a bit out of order on this one. Still working on Block 2, but I wanted to bring something easy to work on at the Guild meet for last night.

![3 squares made of half square triangles, pieced in a line. Off white fabric for one set of triangles. Turquoise with a small leafy pattern for the others.](/images/handmade-hst.jpg)

This is a simple block. It was quick to put together. I'll return to block 2 momentarily!

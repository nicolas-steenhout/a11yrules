title: January Quilting Retreat
---
Went to a sewing retreat with the [Chilliwack's Piecemakers Quilting Guild](https://www.chilliwackpiecemakers.com/) yesterday. Several hours of sewing at a local community hall. It was fun! Sewing and chatting about sewing with like-minded individuals.

I worked on a kit I've been sitting on for a while - I call hit the "Heron quilt", it has a large center panel with a Great Blue Heron. 

I had precut all the fabrics. I made a lot of progress over the day. Very satisfying.

It was the first time I worked with directional fabrics and had to take care with how things go and which way's up!

Today, I finished the quilt top!

Fabrics is "Waterlily Magic" by Jan Mott of Crane Design. Henry Glass & Co, inc.

I'm not sending this immediately to be quilted - we found a kit with the same fabric range to make one large and two small cushions! So have to get and finish those before quilting it.

My long arm quilter is off on vacation until March, so it's not a big issue.

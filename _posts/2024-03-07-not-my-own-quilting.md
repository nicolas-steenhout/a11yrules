title: Not doing my own quilting
---
I must admit to a certain level of embarassment. I haven't done the quilting on most of my quilts so far. I find this a bit embarassing.

As I'm working on binding the "Home is where the heart is" quilt that I got back from the long arm quilter yesterday, I'm admiring her work and am so very happy I outsourced the quilting to someone with the experience and the right tools to do a bang on job. And to be honest, the quilting done by either of the two long arm quilters I used on the few quilts I finished so far have been amazing.

Well beyond my skills. And of course, I need to grow those skills somehow. The only way to do this is to practice doing this. 

I just can't bring myself to potentially ruin some really nice pieces I've done by "practicing" on them. It's all very logical. It makes sense to outsource.

So why do I feel so bad about not being able to do this kind of work? 

I mean, sure. I should be able to just do that kinf of quilting on my home machine while having less than 10 hours of actual quilting under my belt, right? Ha!

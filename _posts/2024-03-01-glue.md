## Elmer's glue

I have been using Elmer's white school glue to baste a lot of my seams. It washes out entirely. It's a great alternative to pins in some situations.

This glue washes completely out after a turn in the washing machine. Never know it was there in the first place.

I did get some tiny 30 ml applicator bottles with a needle nose tip to control where the glue goes.

## Glue stick pen

In a recent workshop I attended, the instructor said she uses glue stick pens, particularly on curved seams because that glue is tacky and doens't need to be set with a hot iron the way Elmer's glue is set.

I haven't received mine yet, but I look forward to try it.

I started working on the Block of the Month project for the Chilliwack Piecemakers Quilting Guild. Started in 2023. We're at block 7. Here are my 7 blocks.

I hadn't posted before because, well, I didn't have a site before!

These blocks are 12 1/2" square

## Block 1 - Colour Notes
![6 strips side by side. Each strip has light fabric at top and bottom, and a colored area in the center. The colored areas are offset and don't match.](/images/bom-01.jpg)

## Block 2 - Square in a Square
![9 smaller squares in 3 rows of 3 columns. Each square has a different color center square](/images/bom-02.jpg)

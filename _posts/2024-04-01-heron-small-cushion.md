I finished the small cushion cover flimsies for this series over the Easter weekend. Quite glad I did!

So now, I only have to add some backing fabric to the backing for the quilt, so the long arm machine can work on the quilt top and the cushions all at the same time, and it'll be ready for the long arm quilter!

<strong>Note:</strong> This is NOT an April fools joke, despite the publication date!

This quilt is the first one I ever completed. Ventured into art quilt early on. Haven't done art quilting since!

![17 inches by 21 inches quilt. The background is yellow. There are two silhouettes of cyclists on racing bikes. The one in the bottom right is nearly black. The one in the top left is grey. They each have a lighter grey shadow beside them. The binding is black. The quilting is basically a bunch of straight lines coming from the cyclists and going to the edges of the quilt](/images/cyclist-quilt.jpg)

This was quite a lot of fun to make, actually. First time doing appliqu&eacute;. I just used a zigzag stich on my machine. No turning of edges or anything. Worked fine!

Made this for a good friend who had, among other things, encouraged my newly forming quilting habit! He's a cyclist.

He recently sent me this photo of the quilt hanging where he has his indoor training bike setup.

Finished this in February 2020!

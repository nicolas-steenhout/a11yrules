I did a couple crib size quilts for friends awaiting babies. 

![series of colorful large half square triangles in orange, blue, yellow, green, and red.](/images/baby-quilt-01.jpg)


![Red and white squares arranted in 9-patch and alternating solid squares.](/images/baby-quilt-02.jpg)

Finished these in August and November 2023!

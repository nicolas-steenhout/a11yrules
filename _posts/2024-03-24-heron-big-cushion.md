I'd hoped to complete the two small and the large cushions this weekend. Turns out I only managed the large one. But I'm happy about this!

I managed to cut all the fabrics for all the cushions. But I was over ambitious. I did not finish. I guess I could make a dent and complete the small cushions as well. But it's a sunny day, and not too cold, and it's the start of nesting season for Great Blue Herons. Soooo, I'm heading out soon to look at herons rather than make a quilt project with herons!

The cushions all include large panels that needed pressed, then fussy cut.

One a green border was added to the panels, they needed to be trimmed.

Pressing and clapping the long seams is always a bit tricky when you work with a small space. This big pillow cover is 53". My working space is 26" x 30". So there's a lot of juggling happening!

Trimming your block makes a difference! Here the top two squares have been trimmed to exactly 3 1/2" per side. The top two haven't been trimmed yet. Doesn't look like much but over an entire quilt, it can make the difference between something that matches and something that's just slightly off.

Onwards! I might be able to get this to the long arm quilter in early April!

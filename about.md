One of my hobbies is making quilts. I do this primarily to get away from computer work. I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination. I'm just having fun with it. I will occasionaly share some musings and tidbits of knowledge so I don't forget them myself!

### More Information

I started making my first quilt, all hand pieced, back in January 2019. It took me nearly a year to complete. I got a sewing machine and started work on another project. And then the pandemic happened, and that complicated our lives in many weird and "wonderful" ways. Bottom line is that it took until 2022 for me to get back to quilting semi-seriously. In the summer of 2023, I got really into it. So by and large, I'm very new to quilting.

Some people have asked if I’m gay. While there are many male quilters who are queer and/or gay, and I enjoy their blogs, YouTubes and works, I’m further an outlier as people try to place a man in quilting: happily cis and married to a woman!

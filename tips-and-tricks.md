I know more about quilting now than I did when I started. This is as it should be - keep on learning. I wish some of the things I know now, I knew then, as it would have made my work better. So I'm going to share them here.

### General thoughts

#### It's not a race

Take your time. Enjoy the process. There's no hurry. A finished product is nice. But, at least for me, the whole point is to be sewing and quilting - the finished product is just a nice to have.

As so many people say: Better finished than perfect!

### Equipment

#### Rulers

Rulers to cut fabric are critical. The problem is, they often slide on the fabric. This means you end up with cuts that aren't straight.

My favorite rulers these days are by [Creative Grid](https://creativegrids.com/). These come with a grippy surface. When you apply pressure on the ruler, it doesn't slide on the fabric. They are, however, not exactly cheap. And you're unlikely to want to buy new rulers if you already have some. 

You can purchase specifically designed stickers to make your existing rulers less slippery. I like the [Wingkind Non-Slip Grips for Quilting Rulers](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07L6TGMJJ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) (note, this is an Amazon link, but they are also available on eBay and at Walmart, I think).

#### Tailor's Clapper

I'd never heard of Clappers until I got one for Christmas. And whoaa boy, is it turning out to be a quilting tool I don't know how I lived without before! Basically, you use it to get flat and crisp seams. Must be hardwood. Can't be plastic. Softwoods like pine, etc aren't going to last long and won't work as well. I was lucky enough to receive one from [Modern American Vintage](https://modernamericanvintage.com/collections/quilting-tools/products/clappers). 

#### Color Catchers

Washing fabrics, or finished quilts, with color catchers is crucial. Especially if you have reds and oranges, colors which bleed a lot into other fabrics. Color catchers are sheets of fabrics designed to absorb the die in the wash. I use [Shout Color Catchers](https://www.shoutitout.com/en-us/products/color-catcher-dye-trapping-sheet), but there are other brands out there.

#### Starch alternatives

This goes with one of the techniques later on this page. I use starch a lot. My preferred starch is actually not a starch, but a starch alternative. I use [MaryEllen's Best Press](https://www.maryellenproducts.com/best-press.html). Unscented, thank you very much.

#### Glue

This item also goes with one of the techniques later in this page. But I like Elmer's white school glue. It washes out entirely, and is a great alternative to pins in some situations.

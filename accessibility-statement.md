## Introduction

I'm committed to accessibility. This website should work for everyone. Simple as that. 

This statement includes a description of my current, and future efforts in accessibility, contact information, and current conformance status, and known issues and workarounds for those issues.

## Contact Information
If you need assistance with this site, the best ways to reach me is via [email](mailto:nic@incl.ca?Subject=Quilting)


## Accessibility Background
I've been working in the field of web accessibility since the early 1990's. I'm an expert accessibility consultant who provides accessibility training and consults with small and large companies. This site, apart from the exceptions listed below, should be working just fine and conform to WCAG 2.1 AA (as of January 2024)

## Current Conformance Status
The site is being developped in February 2024 to meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA. All areas of the site will conform with this accessibility standard. There is still development work being done as of February 2024, and some elements may still need refinement! 

## Feedback
I welcome your feedback on the accessibility of this site. Please let me know if you encounter accessibility barriers on this site.

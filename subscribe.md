I'm providing two ways to keep track of new content:

1. RSS
2. Newsletter

## RSS

You can load this link in your favorite RSS reader: [https://quilting.nicolas-steenhout.com/feed.xml](https://quilting.nicolas-steenhout.com/feed.xml)

## Newsletter

I'm offering a newsletter if RSS isn't your thing. It will not be a high traffic newsletter. I'm looking at sending an update every couple weeks with links to all the new posts. 

You can subscribe by adding your email.

<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/vavroom"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/vavroom', 'popupwindow')"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <label for="bd-email">Enter your email</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" />
  
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
  <p>

## Working with Nic 

<div class="flex-reflow">
  <div>
    <h3>Nic excels at</h3>
    <p>I'll simplify complext topics and explain them in ways that are easier to digest. I use concrete examples and lived stories to illustrate concepts that are sometimes more intangible.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3>Nic's motivations</h3>
    <p>I love working with motivated teams. Curiosity and a desire to learn is key here - because there is a lot to learn about accessibility. It's a great spark for me seeing that metaphorical lightbulb turn on in your head when I explained something and it made you go "ah ha!".</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>The thin line</h3>
    <p>There's a thin line between not doing enough and working within a system's limitation. I'll help you stay accountable. I'll do it with grace and respect because I understand your limitations.</p>

## Meet Nic's colleague, Winston

Winston is Nic's colleague, friend, and companion. Winston is Nic's service dog and you won't often see one without the other.

Winston is fully trained and has three main tasks:

* Pulling Nic's wheelchair 
* Retrieve objects on command
* Help with transfers

## When Nic isn't working in accessibility...

## Bird watching
In his down time, Nic escapes to nature as often as weather permits. He loves bird watching and taking photos of birds.

## Quilting
When the weather doesn't permit, Nic creates patchwork quilts.

The fabrics for the heart are a riot of Kaffe Fassett fabrics in reds, oranges, blues, yellows, and greens.

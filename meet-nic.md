## When Nic isn't working in accessibility...

## Bird watching
In his down time, Nic escapes to nature as often as weather permits. He loves bird watching and taking photos of birds.

## Quilting
When the weather doesn't permit, Nic creates patchwork quilts.

The fabrics for the heart are a riot of Kaffe Fassett fabrics in reds, oranges, blues, yellows, and greens.

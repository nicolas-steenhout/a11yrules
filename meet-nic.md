      <li>I've worked on three continents.</li>
      <li>I will help you identify and navigate complex accessibility challenges.</li>

## Working with Nic 

<div class="flex-reflow">
  <div>
    <h3>Nic excels at</h3>
    <p>I'll simplify complext topics and explain them in ways that are easier to digest. I use concrete examples and lived stories to illustrate concepts that are sometimes more intangible.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3>Nic's motivations</h3>
    <p>I love working with motivated teams. Curiosity and a desire to learn is key here - because there is a lot to learn about accessibility. It's a great spark for me seeing that metaphorical lightbulb turn on in your head when I explained something and it made you go "ah ha!".</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>The thin line</h3>
    <p>There's a thin line between not doing enough and working within a system's limitation. I'll help you stay accountable. I'll do it with grace and respect because I understand your limitations.</p>

  <h2>Meet Nic's colleague, Winston</h2>

  <div class="grid-reflow">
    <div>
      <p>Winston is Nic's colleague, friend, and companion. Winston is Nic's service dog and you won't often see one without the other.</p>
      <p>Winston is fully trained and has three main tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pulling Nic's wheelchair</li>
        <li>Retrieve objects on command</li>
        <li>Help with transfers</li>
      </ul>

## When Nic isn't working in accessibility...

<div class="flex-reflow">
  <div>
    <h3>Bird watching</h3>
    <p>In his down time, Nic escapes to nature as often as weather permits. He loves bird watching and taking photos of birds.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Quilting</h3>
    <p>When the weather doesn't permit, Nic creates patchwork quilts.</p>
    <img src="/img/heart-quilt.jpg" alt="A 60 inch square quilt on the lawn. The quilt has a dark purple background and a patchwork heart shape occupies nearly the entirety of the quilt. The fabrics for the heart are a riot of Kaffe Fassett fabrics in reds, oranges, blues, yellows, and greens. The bottom right of the quilt is folded over showing a teal printed backing">
